--silent (alias -s) (added 1) Does not print anything except for result, including errors. (errors are not printed)

--verbose (alias -v) (added 1) Prints detailed reports of what is going on in addition to a timestamp in milliseconds

--directory (alias -d) (added 4) Changes directory to write 1 MB speedtest file. Directory is provided one space after the --directory or -d and must use quotes if name has spaces
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck --directory /home/me/Downloads
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck --directory "/home/me/Documents/My Project"

--file (alias -f) (added 5) Changes file to write teh 1 MB to. Name is provided 1 space after the switch and quotes must be used if spaces
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck --file myfile.txt //writes to {CWD}/myfile.txt
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck --directory /home/me/Documents --file "this is a file.file" //Writes to /home/me/Documents/this is a file.file

--surpressfile (added 6) Ignores if file exissts and overwrites it instead of throwing an error

--noround (added 7) Does not round speed

--noremove (added 8) Does not remove speedtest file wherever it may be.

--size (alias -si) Changes the file size of the writeable. Size must be an integer in bytes provided one space after the switch
EXAMPLE $diskspeedcheck -si 500000 //Writes a file of 500 KB to test. Calculation is ran to provide answer in MB/s
EXAMPLE $diskspeedcheck --size 44837564 //odd numbers are allowed but no floating points.

-e (alias --excludefmk) Excludes file creation from total time

-a (no alias) Forces test to run multiple times and averages the results. If no valid integer is provided 1 space after, it goes with 10.
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck -a 78 //Runs test 78 times and returns average result
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck -a //Runs test 10 times since no value was provided
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck -a udsf //Value is ignored and is run 10 times

--stricterror (no alias) Instead of surpressing errors and retrying, throws exception immediatly. Does not print anything if --silent (-s) is used
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck -a -1 --stricterror
RETURNS: 0.0 ERROR Negative values are not allowed!
EXAMPLE: $diskspeedcheck -si -1 --stricterror --silent
RETURNS: (nothing, as silent was used)

--help (alias /?) Shows help menu and this file (This is the only argument that requires further user interaction before returning to the command line)
